# QuizByAvengers  

**QuizByAvengers** is a school group project initially built during our +2 class to create an interactive and engaging quiz application. The project was developed using **Java** for the backend and **MySQL** for database management. It allowed users to take quizzes on various topics, track scores, and compete with others. The project was an excellent learning experience in combining programming concepts with database management to deliver a functional application.  

Now, we are reimagining and scaling QuizByAvengers to make it more accessible and industry-ready by leveraging **Flutter** for a modern cross-platform mobile experience.
